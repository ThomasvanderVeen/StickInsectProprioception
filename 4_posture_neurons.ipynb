    "# Notebook 4: Posture Layer\n",
    "\n",
    "### General Overview\n",
    "\n",
    "The posture layer consists of two sub-layers: one tasked with climbing classification (climbing classifier neuron (CCN)) and another responsible for providing a body pitch time course (two pitch estimator neurons (PENs)). These layers were designed to test whether higher-order whole-body locomotion parameters could be extracted from low-level phasic-tonic proprioceptor information. An appropriate higher order posture parameter to extract was body pitch, since the experimental setup required transient, large-amplitude adjustments of the stick insects' body pitch due to the physical steps the insect encountered. Therefore, body pitch was chosen as the locomotion parameter to predict, instead of roll or yaw.\n",
